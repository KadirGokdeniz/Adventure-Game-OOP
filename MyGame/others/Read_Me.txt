Preface

This game designed for fighting.But because of absent of 
quality assets for enemy I could not code them.
I did not give up code. I add a meaningless controller 
such as taking a damage.If I learn how to manage anima-
tions in a better way, I will improve my program.

Controllers:

1-) Press "d" : to go right
2-) Press "a" : to go left
3-) Press "Space": to jump
4-) Press "r": draw the sword (if the sword was drawed,take
it place back.)
5-) Press "Left Click": Swing the sword (Attack Mode1)
6-) Press "Right Click": Swing the sword (Attack Mode2)
7-) Press "f": Take damage from enemy
8-) Press "z": Save the character gold.

Rules:
1-)The main character have 10 block health point.If the gamer
lose all of them the character will die.

2-)Mainly, the gamer must not press any controllers at the same
time.

3-)The game designed for two lewel,the character must take
enough gold to pass another lewel.

4-)If gamer won the game or the character was died, the game ter-
mianted.All controller do will not work.
